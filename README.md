# ⚙️ Enterprise Cybersecurity Risk Management Framework Implementation  
### *(ISO 31000:2018 + NIST RMF)*  

Welcome to my ongoing **Enterprise Cybersecurity Risk Management Framework Implementation** project!  
This repository will showcase my hands-on journey in implementing an enterprise-grade **Cybersecurity Risk Management Framework** that aligns with **ISO 31000:2018** and the **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)**.  

Through this project, I will demonstrate how I intend to integrate governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) principles into practical enterprise cybersecurity operations.  

---

## 🧭 Project Overview  

This project will focus on designing and implementing a **comprehensive cybersecurity risk management program** that aligns business objectives with security and compliance needs.  

I will walk through every stage of the process — from framework design to control implementation and continuous monitoring. Each phase will be documented in this repository as I progress.  

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives  

By the end of this project, I will have:  
- Implemented a **Risk Management Framework (RMF)** based on ISO 31000 and NIST guidelines.  
- Identified, assessed, and treated **enterprise cybersecurity risks** systematically.  
- Integrated **risk management into organizational decision-making** and governance processes.  
- Designed and implemented **cybersecurity controls** to mitigate risks effectively.  
- Created **reporting templates and dashboards** for continuous risk communication and review.  

---

## 🧩 Frameworks and Standards  

The implementation will leverage key principles from:  
- **ISO 31000:2018** – Risk Management Guidelines  
- **NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2** – Risk Management Framework for Information Systems  
- **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1** – Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments  
- **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5** – Security and Privacy Controls

## 🏗️ Implementation Phases  

### **Phase 1: Planning and Framework Design**  
- Define project scope and objectives  
- Identify relevant standards (ISO 31000, NIST RMF)  
- Establish governance and risk management structure  
- Develop organizational context and risk criteria  

### **Phase 2: Risk Identification and Assessment**  
- Identify cybersecurity assets and potential threats  
- Map risks to critical business functions  
- Assess risk likelihood and impact  
- Prioritize risks for mitigation  

### **Phase 3: Risk Treatment and Mitigation**  
- Develop and select appropriate mitigation strategies  
- Implement technical and administrative controls  
- Establish residual risk acceptance criteria  

### **Phase 4: Monitoring and Continuous Improvement**  
- Implement continuous risk monitoring dashboards  
- Schedule risk reviews and audits  
- Apply lessons learned to enhance the framework

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies  

During the project, I will use various tools to support framework implementation and risk management documentation, including:  
- **Microsoft Excel / Power BI** – Risk registers and dashboards  
- **OneTrust / Securiti.ai** – GRC and risk automation  
- **NIST RMF & ISO 31000 Templates** – Framework documentation  
- **GitHub** – Version control and documentation  

---

## 📚 Key Deliverables  

- Enterprise **Cybersecurity Risk Management Policy**  
- **Risk Register** and **Risk Assessment Report**  
- **Risk Treatment Plan**  
- **Continuous Monitoring Dashboard**  
- **Final Framework Implementation Report**
